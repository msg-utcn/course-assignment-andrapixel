# Week 3

## Assignment 

- Clone this week (branch: `week-3`) onto your computer
- Run `npm install` inside the cloned folder
- Install docker onto your device and have it run
- After installing it you should be able to open a terminal and run `docker --version`
- Run the `docker-compose.yml` from this week `/docker` folder using the `docker-compose up` in a terminal opened in that folder
- This will start a postgres database on your device exposed on port `5432` (so take care that port is not in use)
- Now go back to the root folder and run the application using `npm run serve:api`
- It should start the application as in our course
